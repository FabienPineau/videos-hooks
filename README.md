## Requirements

Before running the application, create a .env file in root project directory and define the REACT_APP_API_KEY variable with your YouTube API key.

You can get your YouTube API key in [your Google console developper](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com).

I used [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as package manager.

## Installation

In the project directory, run:

### `yarn install`

Installs all dependencies.

## Run the application

In the project directory, run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deploy the application

In the project directory, run:

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Test your production build:

### `serve -s build`

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

You can deploy your app easily with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
